# DeliveBoo
This is my final project completed as a student at Boolean Academy, and I am excited to present this unique food delivery app. I worked to various aspects of the project: <br>
<b>1)</b> App design, which involved creating a captivating logo, selecting enticing food images, and ensuring an exceptional user experience.<br>
<b>2)</b> Develop of the web app, utilizing an array of technologies including HTML, SASS, Vue, Laravel, and MySQL.<br>
<br>
DeliveBoo name derived from the fusion of "Delivery" and "Boolean," DeliveBoo caters to the ever-evolving digital landscape, while also appealing to the inner geek within us. This logo is a stylized representation of mouthwatering dishes like sandwich, tiramisu, lasagna, made with angle brackets and tildes.<br>
<br>
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the video demonstration of this innovative food delivery web app that combines cutting-edge technology with a passion for exceptional dining experiences.<br>
