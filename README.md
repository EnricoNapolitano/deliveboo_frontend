# DeliveBoo
This is my <b>final project</b> completed as a student at Boolean Academy, and I am excited to present this unique food delivery app. I worked to various aspects of the project: <br>
<b>1) App design</b>, which involved creating a captivating <b>logo</b>, selecting enticing food images, and ensuring an exceptional <b>user experience.</b><br>
<b>2) Develop of the web app</b>, utilizing an array of technologies including <b>HTML, SASS, Vue, Laravel, and MySQL</b>.<br>
<br>
DeliveBoo name derived from the fusion of "Delivery" and "Boolean," DeliveBoo caters to the ever-evolving digital landscape, while also appealing to the inner geek within us. This logo is a stylized representation of mouthwatering dishes like sandwich, tiramisu, lasagna, made with angle brackets and tildes.<br>
<br>
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the video demonstration of this innovative food delivery web app that combines cutting-edge technology with a passion for exceptional dining experiences.<br>
